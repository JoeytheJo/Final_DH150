    "__Summary of Results:__\n",
    "In order to meet the demands for the increased capital requirements of banks, data mining and a decision support system were used to predict if the result of bank telemarketing calls would secure long-term deposits. Four models were explored: logistic regression, decision trees, neural network, and support vector machine. 22 most relevant features were chosen out of 150 input features based on company and economic attributes were used. The neural network model gave the best results among four trained models with an AUC value of 0.8.\n",

    "The article concludes that the Euribor rate was a highly relevant attribute that predicted that clients would save more when the Euribor rate decreased. The Euribor rate is the interest rate at which a panel of European banks borrows funds from one another. Due to the context of a recession that hit, the Portuguese bank data’s most relevant attributes may not be helpful for an efficient telemarketing strategy during stable economic conditions. Additionally, the pressure for banks to meet a profit demand may have allocated more resources to telemarketing than usual which is not necessarily a profitable strategy for the long term.\n",

    "Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) iterations have allowed for a better model that is in tune with the business goals that is useful to improve bank marketing campaigns. With each iteration of the CRISP-DM, the models improved, with the best model being the support vector model with an AUC value of 0.938. The top five most relevant inputs for a marketing campaign were identified as call duration, the month of contact, the number of previous contacts, days since the last contact, the last contact result, and the first constant duration. \n",

    "No limitations, biases, or data shortcomings were described in this article. The article does mention that a possible expansion of this article would be to see if these predictive models can be achieved without contact-based information, which would further impede the customers’ privacy. A lot of the information that is being used to decide whether a customer should be contacted is provided by the customer to the banks initially for financial reasons and not for telemarketing purposes. The modern bank customer is wary of telemarketing strategies and does not prefer direct marketing calls from banks, so the application of this dataset to current banks may need to adapt for the digital bank customers.\n",

    "Class-membership (CMB) classifier approach is proposed to transform heterogeneous data by processing data types. Due to the technological evolution that has allowed machine learning algorithms and data mining tools, more efficient forecasting of marketing campaigns and business adjustments have resulted. However, this means that rich data that is used such as volume, complexity, and heterogeneity that must be accounted for. Although the data mining ANN model was the best model with an AUC of 0.975, the CMB model is the 2nd best model with an AUC of 0.959.\n",

    "The article mentions the shortcomings of heterogeneous data, achieving optimal performance, and using minimal resources. Usually, non-numerical variables in the data cause over-fitting or slowing down of the model, which is hopefully addressed by using the CMB approach. The article mentions limitations of the experiment protocol, in which they did not balance the data. Additionally, the article describes that some features of the dataset are not known until after a telemarketing call, such as the duration.\n"

Based on these metrics, KNN is a better model. However, due to the imbalanced models, ROC and/or AUC should be used to determine accuracy of model, as seen in the example I did for Logistic Regression."
